# 2DEXP
The 2DEXP is a generalization to the exponential distribution to 2 dimensions and 3 parameters- two of the normal rate parameters and a new 'association' parameter.
The main properties are:

(X,Y) is a continuous distribution over [0,Infty)x[0,Infty)
(X|Y) and (Y|X) are exponentially distributed variables, but X and Y are not
(X,Y) is an exponential family distribution, and has easy-to-compute sufficient statistics
Coefficients p and q control for the rate of the distribution, whereas r controls the level of association between them.
The correlation between X and Y is negative

See the wiki for the general mathematical statistics as well as the derivations involved.
